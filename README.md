# 8P361 Project AI for MIA - Group 3
*Does a convolutional neural network pick up on artificially added confounding factors?*

This repository contains python code used to generate results for group 3's submission of the assignments and main project of 8P361 (Project AI for MIA). 

### Running code
An external dataset based on the PatchCamelyon dataset is required to run the code, which can be downloaded [here](google.com). This file should be unpacked in a way that produces a `/datasets/` folder in the root of the repository.
Two extra python packages were used: cv2 and seaborn. These need to be installed along with the base packages of this course to run the code.
The code in the `/main_project/` folder was used for the final results.
